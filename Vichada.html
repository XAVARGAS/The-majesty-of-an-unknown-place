  <p>And that is: a place where the waters flood everything and then dry up, where the morichal becomes tall grass and then dust; a vast plain that seems infinite and where the sunsets are always magnificent, interconnected by rivers that come from the jungle. Here alligators live almost hidden by the mud, nervous chigüiros and pink dolphins. This corner of the country is embraced by the Orinoco that links two countries in landscape, waters and identity.</p>

  <p>All this is on the unknown border of Colombia: on that natural limit before the border with Venezuela and Brazil, to which few Colombians have gone. Why? Nothing seems to invite us to a territory so vast and distant. But there is an excuse: the naturalist Alexander von Humboldt recorded it and was amazed, and now there are plans that follow his path for you to do as well. Take your route to show the greatness of the least explored territory in the country.</p>

  <h4> THE MAJESTY OF AN UNKNOUW PLACE IN COLOMBIA.</h4>
  <div>
  <p>  Three surprising places</p>
  <ul>
  <li>PARQUE TUPARRO could be described as a vast green savannah crossed by large rivers with powerful streams and golden beaches, small channels of crystalline waters, gallery forests, morichales and saladillales, in addition to enormous crystalline rocks in the form of rounded hills. Here the presence of more than 320 species of birds, many of them aquatic, is calculated.</li>

  <li>FEEL THE JUNGLE AND THE PLAIN In Vichada, Guainía and Guaviare there is a bit of everything. From the snakes that hug branches as in the illustrations that we all have in our memory, to rivers that twist through the center of the department and the sonorous words of plants. In Vichada there are cachicamos (armadillos), cachirres (babillas), they eat beech and cambur (banana) and they talk to little houses (friends): this is the Llano.</li>

  <li>SEE THE RIVERS There is something you will not be able to summarize in words to your friends and family when you return: the spell of calm. At this point you will already begin to be another. Correction: yourself. The one he was before getting lost in the tidal wave of everyday life. He will undress before the invisible energy that will reconnect him with himself.</li>

During this first part of the tour we will have the opportunity to appreciate different ecosystems formed by arizales, riparian forests, rocky outcrops and gallery forests. From Casuarito we continue our boat trip to the mouths of the Caño Mesetas and from there we will walk for about an hour to the port known as El Tablon. The walk is only done with cameras and water bottles for hydration, since our travel luggage will be collected by boat through the streams of Atures and Palo Masón, which we will have the opportunity to appreciate during the walk. These streams are listed as the widest rapids in the world. From the board we will continue our boat trip on the Orinoco river to the Garcitas community, we will have lunch there. Then we start our boat tour to El Tuparro National Natural Park located 30 kilometers from Garcitas. This day we will visit the Park Visitors Center and then we will move to our base camp that will be located at the mouth of the Tuparro River in the Orinoco. After settling in, we headed to Cerro el Guahibo to visit an indigenous cemetery and then hike through the Maipures rapids, listed by expeditionary naturist Alexander von Humboldt as the eighth wonder of the world. We return to our camp for dinner and rest.</li>

DAY 3. We have breakfast and begin our trip through the Tomo river towards the mouth of the Caño Peinillas, where there is an important rocky outcrop called Cerro Peinillas, whose vegetation and presence of forests of different strata allow us to house species of flora and fauna in particular. . At the top of the hill after observing the majesty of the plain, we visit the indigenous cemetery and the pictographs, then descend to swim in the calm waters of the Caño Peinillas and return to the camp for lunch. In the afternoon we start our tour of the Attalea interpretive trail, crossing a forest associated with a rocky outcrop and where you can see species of trees and palm trees that local communities use in their subsistence activities. At the end of the trail we reach the Mirador, a point from which a spectacular panoramic view of the Maipures stream is achieved. The return to base camp is made at approximately 5:30 p.m. for dinner and rest.</li>
