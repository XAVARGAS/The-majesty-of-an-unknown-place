<li>The Golden Circle
Today, you'll spend your day admiring Iceland's most visited natural attractions, aptly named the Golden Circle. From Reykjavík, you'll be whisked away on a minibus to the first site of the day; the historic Þingvellir National Park where Iceland's parliament was founded over a thousand years ago.</li>

<li>South Iceland & Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon
The South Coast of Iceland is filled with breathtaking wonders and today, you'll start your two day trip along it.

First up, you will see Seljalandsfoss waterfall, a stunning high and narrow cascade that falls over a 62-metre cliff face. Behind the curtain of falling water, a large cave is visible, and in the winter, this majestic waterfall is illuminated by strong lights.</li>

<li>
Blue Ice Cave in Vatnajokull National Park
Today, you'll have the rare opportunity to visit a natural ice cave. You'll start the day by hopping on a large custom SUV known as a 'super jeep' and enjoy an adventurous trip over the harsh terrain leading to the cave.

Ice caves are only accessible from November until March each year, so a trip to one is truly a unique experience.  The caves vary in size and shape and change daily. In the right light and conditions, they are exquisitely beautiful, shrouded in stunning electric blue colours. </li>
